The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to calculate the ground state energy level of a particle. VQEâ€™s approach utilizes quantum computation to develop states, which are then optimized by varying circuit parameters via classical methods. Compared to other proposals to find the ground state VQE is computationally less expensive, and has practical applications/tests.
